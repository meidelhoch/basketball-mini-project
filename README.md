# basketball-mini-project
Partner mini project for Intro to Data Science (STAT.220). My partner and I created a web app using shiny.io to analyze NBA players. The exploratory data analysis and web scraping and data cleaning was done in practice_mini_3.rmd and start_here.rmd and then the shiny app was created within the basketball_app directory.
